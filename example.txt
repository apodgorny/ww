Decompose the intent expressed in the text into INTENT INVARIANTS.

INTENT INVARIANTS are conditions such that:
- if all invariants hold, the intent holds;
- if any invariant is violated, the intent is violated.

Each invariant represents one independent aspect of the intent meaning.

Each invariant:
- states a required condition,
- is short and concrete (one sentence),
- can be evaluated as true or false.

Output format:
- Numbered list.
- One invariant per line.
- Plain statements only.

INTENT BEGIN:

Design a system that coordinates multiple AI agents to solve a complex task.
Agents may use different tools, share intermediate results, and adapt their behavior
based on partial outcomes. The system should prioritize progress toward the task goal
over individual agent preferences and be extensible to new agent types and tools.

INTENT END

-----
1. The system must coordinate multiple AI agents.
2. Agents should utilize different tools.
3. Agents must share intermediate results.
4. Agents should adapt their behavior based on partial outcomes.
5. The system must prioritize task goal completion.
6. The system should be extensible to new agent types.
7. The system should be extensible to new tools.



propose 3 uses for such tool. One sentence each

1.  **Scientific Discovery:** The system could accelerate research by allowing AI agents to autonomously design experiments, analyze 
data, and formulate hypotheses across various scientific disciplines.
2.  **Complex Logistics Optimization:** The system could manage and optimize intricate supply chains, dynamically adjusting routes, 
inventory levels, and resource allocation based on real-time conditions.
3.  **Personalized Education:** The system could create adaptive learning pathways for students, with AI agents tailoring content, 
providing feedback, and adjusting the difficulty level based on individual learning needs and progress. 


Form a request to build a system that could do any of the below (genertae 4 sentences)


“We require the development of a sophisticated AI-driven system capable of tackling complex challenges across diverse domains. This 
system must autonomously perform tasks like designing experiments (for scientific discovery), optimizing logistics networks, and 
creating personalized learning experiences.  Crucially, it needs to integrate real-time data analysis, adaptive learning algorithms, 
and dynamic decision-making capabilities.  Ultimately, we envision a system that significantly enhances efficiency and effectiveness 
in any chosen application.”
